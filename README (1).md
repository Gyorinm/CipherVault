 CipherVault â€“ Universal Data Encryption Framework

CipherVault is a flexible, secure, and developer-friendly encryption framework designed to protect your most sensitive data â€” from personal documents to enterprise assets â€” using robust cryptographic standards and a streamlined CLI interface.

Purpose
CipherVault helps individuals, developers, and organizations encrypt files, folders, or even entire datasets easily â€” with full control over algorithms, encryption modes, and stealth protection. No GUI clutter. No cloud dependencies. Just pure encryption, on your terms.

 Key Features
Multi-layer encryption support
  AES-256, Fernet, XOR â€“ choose your preferred algorithm per use case.

Folder & file-level encryption 
  Encrypt entire directories or single files with ease.

Stealth Mode
  Disguise encrypted files as innocent-looking images (JPG containers).

-Backup & recovery system 
  Automatic backup before encryption and auto-cleanup after decryption.

- Smart auto-discovery 
  Just provide the filename â€“ CipherVault searches intelligently across common folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documentsâ€¦).

Strong key derivation & hashing
  PBKDF2-HMAC (100K iterations) + SHA-512 + Nonce for maximum resistance.

- Modular code structure 
  Easy to extend and integrate in your own Python-based security tools.

Quick Start

 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CipherVault.git
cd CipherVault
```

 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 3. Run basic encryption
```bash
python ciphervault_inplace.py --encrypt --file "example.pdf" --password "StrongKey123"
```

---

ðŸ§© Use Case Examples

Encrypt a folder:
```bash
python ciphervault_inplace.py --encrypt --folder "Projects" --password "MyFolderKey"
```

Enable stealth mode:
bash
python ciphervault_inplace.py --encrypt --file "secret.docx" --password "Stealthy!" --stealth


 Decrypt a file:
bash
python ciphervault_inplace.py --decrypt --file "example.pdf.cvault" --password "StrongKey123"

ðŸ§ª Security Notes

- All encryption is local. No remote storage or telemetry.
- Keys and passwords are never stored.
- Encrypted files are undecryptable without the correct password*.
- No backdoors, no hidden keys. What you encrypt is yours alone.
